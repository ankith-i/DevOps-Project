## Implementing a CI/CD Pipeline: Jenkins, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy Integration

This project seeks to seamlessly integrate Jenkins, a renowned open-source automation server, with AWS services like CodeBuild and CodeDeploy. The core objective is to automatically compile, build, and deploy code artifacts whenever there are code changes pushed to a GitHub repository. This creates a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline which improves the efficiency and reliability of software development and deployment processes.

## Steps to Implement the CI/CD Pipeline:

### 1. Setting Up Infrastructure Resources:
The first phase involves provisioning and configuring the necessary AWS resources:

- **Amazon S3 Bucket**: Used for storing both the GitHub repository files and the artifacts generated by CodeBuild.
- **IAM Roles & Policies**: Several roles and policies are created to facilitate secure communication and actions between the resources:
    - **JenkinsRole**: Allows Jenkins hosted on an EC2 instance to write to the S3 bucket and create CodeDeploy deployments.
    - **CodeDeployRole**: Grants EC2 instances of CodeDeploy permission to both write to the S3 bucket and initiate deployments.
    - **CodeBuildRole**: Lets CodeBuild access the S3 bucket and establish build projects.
    - **IAM S3 bucket policy**: Enables the Jenkins server to access the S3 bucket.
    - **CodeDeploy Service Role**: Allows CodeDeploy to interface with instance tags or the EC2 Auto Scaling group names.
- **Jenkins Server**: An EC2 instance tasked with running Jenkins.
- **CodeBuild Project**: Configured with the S3 bucket for code compilation.
- **Auto Scaling Group**: Contains EC2 instances running Apache and the CodeDeploy agent. They are fronted by an Elastic Load Balancer.
- **Security Groups**: Define access permissions for Jenkins server, the load balancer, and the CodeDeploy EC2 instance.

### 2. Access and Initialization of the Jenkins Server:

1. Retrieve the `JenkinsServerDNSName` from the CloudFormation stack's Outputs tab and access it through a browser.
2. Unlock the Jenkins server by SSH-ing using the provided IP address and the associated key pair. Follow the on-screen instructions to unlock Jenkins.
3. As the root user, display the Jenkins log (`/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log`) to find the auto-generated alphanumeric password. Use this password to unlock Jenkins.

### 3. Project Creation & Jenkins Plugin Configuration:

By integrating the Jenkins plugin for CodeDeploy, you can automate the deployment phase of your CI/CD pipeline. 

1. Create a new Jenkins project.
2. In the project configuration, set up the CodeDeploy plugin with the necessary AWS credentials and application specifications.

### 4. Testing the CI/CD Pipeline:

To ensure the pipeline works end-to-end:

1. Commit an application to your GitHub repository.
2. Observe the automated triggers in action on the Jenkins dashboard.
3. Check the build and deployment logs for any potential issues.
4. Upon successful deployment, access the application via the Elastic Load Balancer's DNS name to verify everything operates as expected.
